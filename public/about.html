            <h2><strong>Background Information:</strong></h2>
            <p><h5><strong>Project Background :</strong></h5> I decided to develop this chat application website to meet the needs of modern social interaction. Real-time communication has become an important part of people's online interactions, and I wanted to provide a convenient platform that allows users to chat and share information in real-time.</p>

               <p> <h5><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE: </strong></h5>My target audience is broad and includes individual users, small teams, online communities, and professionals who need to collaborate in real time. My chat app is designed to cater for a variety of usage scenarios.</p>

                <p><h5><strong>Technology Stack:</strong></h5> I used Node.js as the server-side runtime environment, Express.js to build the web server, and Socket.IO for real-time communication. The client-side part uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h2><strong>Development details:</strong></h2>
            <p>
                <p><h5><strong>Project Planning: </strong></h5>At the beginning of the project, I clearly defined the scope of the project, which included user registration, live chat, user list, system messages, and the status of what the user is typing. I created sketches and prototypes to design the user interface.</p>

                <p><h5><strong>Server-side development: </strong></h5>I set up the Express.js server and used Socket.IO to manage real-time communication. I maintained a list of users to keep track of connected users. I notified all clients via Socket.IO when users connected and disconnected.</p>

                <p><h5><strong>Client-side development: </strong></h5>I designed the intuitive user interface, including the message input box, chat history, and user list. I used Socket.IO to receive and send chat messages and implemented an indication that the user is typing. All these features are implemented in the browser.</p>

                <p><h5><strong>Deployment and extensions: </strong></h5>I considered future extensions to the site, including adding more functionality and improving the user experience.</p>

                <p><h5><strong>Challenges and solutions: </strong></h5>During the development process, I encountered a number of challenges, such as dealing with the complexity of real-time communication and the management of user lists. Through careful planning and looking up information, I managed to overcome these challenges.</p>

                <p><h5><strong>Learning experience: </strong></h5>This project taught me a lot about real-time communication, front-end and back-end development. I will continue to learn and improve to provide a better user experience.</p>

                <p><h5><strong>Future plans: </strong></h5>I plan to continue to improve and extend the chat application by adding more features, improving performance and security, and optimising based on user feedback.</p>
